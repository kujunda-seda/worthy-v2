# Project rules

## Project organization

1. A master version of the project is stored on the GitHub service.
2. The official repository name is `worthy-v2` (or __Repo__).
2. __Repo__ is owned by Kujunda Seda OÜ - a design bureau, based in Tallinn, Estonia.
3. __Repo__ is the single _source of truth_ for the project.
4. All other communications related to the project (phone calls, meetings, Slack, emails etc.) are considered secondary. Important results of such communications must be saved either as project issues or in project documentation. Everything else may be safely discarded.

## Documentation rules

1. All project documentation must be stored in the __Repo__'s `documentation` folder.
2. The only exception to the rule above is the default `README.md` file, which is stored in the __Repo__ root and aims to give an overview of the project to outside users.
3. All project documentation must be in English.

## Issues and milestones

1. Issue is created for an indivisible to-do item. Always split complex tasks into smaller indivisible to-do items.
2. Major important stages of the project should be created as GitHub _milestones_.
3. It is possible to skip creating an issue if the time required to implement a fix for the issue is comparable with the time necessary to create an issue ticket on GitHub.
4. Still, if the issue is important enough to be saved in project history, the issue must be created.

## File naming convention

1. Files and folders should be named in lower case with spaces replaced by dash `-`.
2. All unnecessary words should be skipped, e.g. `The product features for version 1.0` should be named `product-features-1.0.md`.
3. Generated files with predefined rules should be left as is, e.g. GitHub `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` or Flutter `worthy_app`.
